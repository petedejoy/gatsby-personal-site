I often get asked by peers and colleagues about how I learned how to program. With the recent spike in demand for technical talent, software engineering is indeed an attractive skillset for just about anyone to add to their resume. And rightfully so; especially at startups where many different business units interface with new and exciting technology, you will never be less valuable for having a technical skillset under your belt.

The truth is that I’ve had a hard time articulating a good, clear answer when I’m asked; I never did a bootcamp, didn’t study CS, and never really envisioned myself being a programmer. A variety of factors ended up coming together to create the “perfect storm” of learning programming. I hope this post serves to articulate how that storm came together, nod the things that were game changers in my professional development, and teach you how to drum up your own storm.
