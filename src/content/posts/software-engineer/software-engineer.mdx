I often get asked by peers and colleagues about how I learned how to program. With a recent spike in demand for technical talent, software engineering is indeed an attractive skillset to have on your resume. And rightfully so; especially at startups where many different business units interface with new and exciting technology, you will never be less valuable for having a baseline level of technical knowledge.

The truth is that I’ve had a hard time articulating a good, clear answer when I’m asked; I never did a bootcamp, didn’t study CS, and never really envisioned myself being a programmer. At the end of the day, a variety of factors ended up coming together to create the perfect storm of learning programming.


## Where it Started

Just over two years ago, I began my career as an Account Development Representative (startup slang for entry-level salesperson doing a whole lotta cold outreach) for a growing startup seeking to establish product-market fit in the data analytics space.

I was our 48th hire.

As you can imagine, I had no clue what I was getting into; I had studied chemistry and physics in college, thought startups were rad, and had accepted a fellowship with [Venture for America](ventureforamerica.org). Like most fresh college grads, I had no idea what my day-to-day would look like when I actually touched down and started my career, the company seemed like a place where I could learn a ton, the people seemed cool, and I had heard a whole lot of buzz about “big data”, which all came together in what seemed to be a compelling opportunity to dive into the world of startups.

Soon after I began, the company hit turbulence. An ambitious growth strategy coupled with a resource-starved product forced our executives to lay off 70% of our employees about two months after I joined the team. The rest of us would stick around and focus on narrowing our vision to pursue our product line that was beginning to see traction. I was chosen to stick around because, well, I was cheap and eager.

After a gnarly few months that included a handful of voluntary departures from the company, a full spinoff of our secondary product and the folks responsible for running it, a lot of discussion around our direction, and some vision-casting around where future opportunity would be, we ended up with a group of 7 people ready and willing to do whatever it took to build a product that generated value for its users.

We went heads-down for a few months. I remained in a growth role (albeit a less defined one than the one I had joined for), and our engineers hunkered down on building our MVP product.

Once we finally had something to release to the public, things got crazy pretty quickly. We had an increasing number of prospects wanting us to build specific features and felt strongly that we [had stepped on a landmine of product/market fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-vfn97QTr0). 

Along with the accelerated interest came the need for engineers; as it turns out, when you’re a small team in the early stages of building a developer tool, technical firepower is essential across every area of the business. There was just one problem: we were quickly running out of cash from our previous round of financing and couldn’t hire the folks we needed to push some of our critical technical projects over the finish line.

<h2>Sink or Swim</h2>
</a>

We had an endless list of engineering projects across the board that needed to be tended to, and, at the time, our CTO, CEO, and a single junior developer were doing the bulk of the technical heavy lifting. One of the features that our growth team desperately needed involved collecting payment information from users of our SaaS product. We were maturing fast and beginning to generate real value for our customers; people wanted to pay us for the service, but we didn't quite know how to collect their credit card information and lacked the resources required to build a robust integration with any popular payment APIs.

I’ll save the nitt-gritty of the learning process for my [project write-up](petedejoy.com/projects/billing), but to make a long story short, we had a lot of interest in our product and no way to get people to pay us money. This meant we had no way to grow our revenue footprint, which meant that I was failing in my job as a Growth Manager. Something needed to be built, and it needed to be built fast. We were in dire straits and developing a technical skillset was, at the time, the only way to do my job effectively.


## Fueling the Fire

Whereas desperation lit the flame, a collection of other factors kept it burning increasingly brightly over the year that followed. I chose to use [Stripe](https://stripe.com) as our payment integration tool, as their API is extremely well-documented and they had open-sourced a ton of example code that I could rip off of. I would get a tremendous amount of help from the smart folks around me and truly learned how to leverage the resources of the internet. On top of that, as I began to spin up my sample project, learn the ins-and-outs of [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and start writing (rather, copying and pasting) my first lines of Javascript, I found myself unbelievably excited by the prospect on working on a project that would, hopefully, result in a deliverable product. A couple of frustrated hours a week quickly turned into focused nightly sessions, full Saturdays spent reading and debugging, and a feverish desire to learn about the why behind everything I was doing. It’s cool to build things.

### Have an Application

No, I don’t mean a web or mobile application. Rather, learning programming, like anything in life, is much more approachable and enjoyable if you have a place to apply your knowledge as you develop it. For me, the application was in the [billing app that I was building to make my job as a Growth Manager easier](https://petedejoy.com/projects/billing); having a final deliverable that I was accountable for kept me learning in my hours at night even when things got super frustrating and it felt like I hit a brick wall in my learning. Before you start writing a single line of code, spend a few weeks scoping out a final project that will have real-world use for your personal life or job. Tailor your learning and every hour you sink in towards the delivery of that project.


### Be Down to Look Stupid

Learning to program is intimidating, especially if you work in an environment surrounded by senior engineers who naturally are going to speak way over your head. Accept the fact that you’re going to be miles behind the people around you when you start and ask all of the stupid questions. Hell, ask them 5 times. If someone answers you in a condescending way (this is unfortunately typical in engineering culture), find someone else to ask. And leave your excuses at the door. Conceding that you “don’t have the right brain” to grasp technical concepts is like saying you can’t exercise because you have bad hand-eye coordination.

### Find Good Mentorship

I was unbelievably lucky to have a strong coach by my side in [Astronomer CTO Greg Neiheisel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-neiheisel/). Even in his infinite wisdom and jam-packed schedule, he was willing to spend hours with me at any hour of the day or night debugging menial issues and walking through super junior-level programming concepts. In what felt like a massive victory for me, as I continued to learn I was able to pay some of it forward by helping him with some easier projects that he wouldn’t have otherwise had time to do. His patience was massively key for me here- as mentioned above, it’s super intimidating when you first start learning to code and are surrounded by seasoned engineers and, without a support system, you can fall off the wagon quickly. Surround yourself with patient folks who have a vested interest in your learning process and you’ll be well-poised to succeed.


### The Internet is your Best Friend

I’d argue that programming is the most valuable (in terms of annual salary you can make per spent learning) professional skill you can develop using the resources at your disposal on the internet. I personally had success with Udemy courses and began inhaling them at the fastest pace I could. I’d recommend starting as basic and high-level as possible; I tried to learn React before knowing any HTML/CSS/JS and that proved to be a massive challenge. Look for courses that are highly-rated and incorporate some project elements; as mentioned in (1) having tangible deliverables to work on that ended in a final and presentable form keeps excitement snowballing as you began to understand what was going on under the hood.

## The Programmer’s Paradox

Many people try and fail in their mission to learn how to program. Getting to the point where you are a hireable asset is a challenge that requires a massive up-front investment, which proves to be a barrier to entry to many. When you’re getting started, the learning curve looks something like this:

And all is great and you are a genius. But, once you spend many, many hours fighting that battle, you find out that no one told you that the y axis there isn’t to scale, and the graph actually looks like this:

But feeling dumb again isn’t as bad as it seems! The process of constant learning and development is why programming is so awesome- it’s a never-ending rabbit hole of self-education and, while the path forward can be overwhelming, building a foundation exposes you to a new world of professional and personal development that is all too worth it.
