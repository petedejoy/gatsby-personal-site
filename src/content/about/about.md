I'm a cofounder and lead Product at [Astronomer](https://astronomer.io), working with an incredible team of folks to deliver the world's data via a portfolio of open-source and commercial products.

As I've watched the Astronomer team grow from 6 to 200 and beyond, I've worn quite a few different hats across our sales, product, and engineering teams. These days, I spend my time leading our Product organization, working with an incredible team of engineers, designers, and product managers to create incredible experiences for data engineers around the world. While I admittedly don't get quite as much programming time in my day-to-day as I once did, I enjoy rolling up my sleeves when the time and opportunity present themselves.

Spending most of my professional life surrounded by brilliant software engineers has made me realize one thing: I'm inspired by hands-on creators with unwavering belief in their ideas. I enjoy building tools that help empower those folks to create.

In a past life, I played football at the collegiate level and was a competitive ski racer. My academic years were spent toiling with physics and chemistry, but most of that mental real-estate has since been replaced by Stack Overflow answers.

Outside of work, I'm into vintage guitars, the state of Vermont (although I don't live there), music theory, exploring new places on skis, and the New York Mets.
