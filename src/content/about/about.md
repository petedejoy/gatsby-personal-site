I'm part of the founding team at [Astronomer](https://astronomer.io), a globally-distributed company working hard to solve some of the world's toughest data problems.

As I've watched the Astronomer team grow from 6 to 160 and beyond, I've worn quite a few different hats across our sales, product, and engineering teams. These days, I spend my time on our Cloud service, working with an incredible team of engineers, designers, and product managers to create beautiful experiences for our customers. While I admittedly don't get quite as much programming time in my day-to-day as I once did, I've spent a lot of time writing code in javascript and python-based frameworks and enjoy rolling up my sleeves when the time and opportunity present themselves.

Spending most of my adult life surrounded by brilliant software engineers has made me realize one thing: I'm deeply inspired by hands-on creators with unwavering belief in their ideas. I'm passionate about building high-leverage tools that help enable those folks to build more efficiently and effectively and I plan on pursuing that mission for many years to come.

In a past life, I played football at the collegiate level and was a competitive ski racer. My academic years were spent toiling with physics and chemistry, but most of that intellectual real-estate has since been replaced by distributed systems, microservice architectures, and Stack Overflow answers.

Outside of work, I'm into vintage guitars, the state of Vermont (although I don't live there), music theory, exploring new places on skis, and the New York Mets.
