### BA in Chemistry and Physics

I went to [Bowdoin College](bowdoin.edu), where I studied Chemistry and Physics. I was pre-med, so much of my time was spent in the scientific realm, but Bowdoin's liberal arts philosophy allowed me to spend sigificant time focusing on Music Theory, Spanish, English Literature, and Film Studies. I loved being able to be broad in my academic focus- I wish i could have majored everything.

On campus, I was a member of the varsity football team, a captain of the club alpine ski team, and played guitar and keys in a band.
