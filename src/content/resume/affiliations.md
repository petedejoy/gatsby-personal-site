## Venture for America :earth_americas:

<br/>

Venture For America is a fellowship for recent grads who want to learn how to build a business while making an impact. VFA Fellows get training and join a startup in an emerging US city, where they live and work for two years at one of our hundreds of partner companies. They learn hands-on what it takes to build a company, while getting the mentorship, network, and ongoing support to prepare themselves to become successful entrepreneurs. Our goal is to spark job growth in cities that need it by sending our top-talent to help grow the businesses that will make it happen.
