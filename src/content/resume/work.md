## Astronomer :rocket:

### Technical Product Manager

I currently work at [Astronomer](https://astronomer.io), a fast-growing startup working to build a platform around the open-source project [Apache Airflow](https://http://airflow.apache.org).

In my tenure at Astronomer, I've served as a cross between a Platform Engineer, Product Manager, and Growth Manager. Currently, I'm focused on building features into our core product's React front end and Node back end to help smooth over and optimize conversion for trial users. I also am often on sales calls to walk through our techincal infrastrucure with enterprise DevOps teams.
