## Astronomer :rocket:

### Product Manager

I was one of the first employees at [Astronomer](https://astronomer.io), a fast-growing startup working to build a platform around the open-source project [Apache Airflow](https://http://airflow.apache.org).

At Astronomer, I've worn many different hats but all have been close to our core product. Namely I've done stints as a Platform Engineer, Product Manager, Growth Manager, and Sales Engineer.

Recently, I've been focused on scaling out our product strategy and working on the go-to-market for a new product offering. I am deeply embedded in engagements with some of our biggest enterprise prospects to architect solutions and translate enterprise organizational needs into strategic product decisions.
