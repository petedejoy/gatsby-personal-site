A semi-regular podcast that I produce focused on the evolution of Apache Airflow as the gold standard for data engineering. I'm responsible for booking interviews, moderating interviews, and all of the audio production and mixing. We've had some really awesome guests come on the show, including Airflow creator Maxime Beauchemin.
