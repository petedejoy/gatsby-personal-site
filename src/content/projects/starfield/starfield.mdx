## Overview

This project is fairly immature and probably won't warrant much more work, but it's intended to b a three-dimensional rotating starfield that I built using the [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber) library. It's designed to mirror the experience of an individual standing and gazing at the night sky. If you can click on a star, you'll get a nice interactive surprise.

I really just used this as an opportunity to play around with ThreeJS in React via r3f- it's super cool stuff and makes you realize how powerful a browser can actually be.
