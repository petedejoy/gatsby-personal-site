## What is it?

A repo of Apache Airflow DAGs that fetch and aggregate daily state-related COVID data from the [covidtracking.com API](https://covidtracking.com), push that data as a series of CSV files to [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), and then load those CSVs downstream into [Snowflake](https://snowflake.com) tables using the [S3 to Snowflake Transfer Operator](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6469/files).

These DAGs are used for various Airflow trainings and help explain the fundamentals of Airflow from the ground up.
