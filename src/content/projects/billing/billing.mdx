To satisfy my company's need for the ability to collect payment information, I built a Node app using the Stripe Elements library that successfully collects credit card information, tokenizes it on an Express server, then makes an API call to Stripe to create a new customer with an associated credit card. The server also also makes an API call to Mailchimp so that an onboarding drip campaign can be kicked off. I did this with 0 prior experience in Javascipt or Node, so it was quite the learning experience and was the first professional programming project I tackled.
