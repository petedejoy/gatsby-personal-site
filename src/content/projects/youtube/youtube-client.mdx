## Nothing fancy

What you see is what you get with this one, folks! this is a super simple React client that pings the Youtube API to return a list of videos when you search.

I understand that this project isn't particularly "showcaseable", but it was one of the first programming projects I did and it was a great way to show a ton of React fundatmentals, including state management and lifecycle methods, in a super simple application.
